# Diary
Before beginning the project I decided to write this file to explain my thought process while creating the app.
It may also act as a to-do list and note-taking file. We'll see how it evolves.

## Day 1

## Starting the project
Top of the morning to you. I started to polish my portfolio and decided I need a new project in it. After some thinkingI decided that the project will be a CV maker. Another React project for my portfolio, yay. I thought about doing
something in Python or Go, but this seemed like a good learning project, since I intend to use many new tools that I am not so familiar with. After a bit of research, these are the tools and stack I will be using:

- Start the project with Vite
- Github for version control
- Design the app with Figma
- CI/CD with Jenkins
- Automate the testing
- Deploy the app to my VPS NGINX server

I think that's enough for now. Some things may change if I find better alternatives. I will be doing forest clearance work during days, so let's see how much time I have to invest in this project.

The project structure is now created with the latest Vite version. Time to clear the files from unnecessary stuff.

The project files are now ready for the first git commit. After that is time to design the app in Figma. For now I need a simple starting page with a description of the page and a button for creating a cv. Next is the cv creation page that has a sample cv that user can modify. On the left of creation page is the menu that has buttons for cv theme and various settings (TBD). On the bottom of the menu there is a button for exporting to pdf.

The CV structure will be a structure that I learnt on a university course. And oh, if I forgot to mention it, the app will be in Finnish. Hence the name "CV-Velho", "CV-Wizard" in English.
